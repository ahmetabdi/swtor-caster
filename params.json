IF you're on Windows 8 or 10, you'll most likely already have this installed. However the setup should also take care of this for you.\r\n\r\n## [Download latest release](http://pjmagee.synology.me/swtorcaster/publish.htm)\r\n\r\n### Here are some reasons to give SWTOR Caster a try\r\n\r\n* Add some character to your stream and stand out from the rest.\r\n* Viewers can learn class rotation with being able to see the abilities you use and in what order.\r\n* Great for PvP and to show off some of those skills.\r\n* People might ask what your opener is on an enemy, but now they can see it clearly.\r\n* You can hide the ability text for a minimalist look.\r\n* Shows with most \"activated\" abilities (Medpacks, Mounting, Combat etc...)\r\n\r\n### SWTOR Enable combat log\r\n\r\nBe sure to enable the combat log file. SWTOR Caster reads this file like other third party DPS/HPS Parsers.\r\n\r\n![Client Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjmagee/swtor-caster/master/Screenshots/swtor-game-combat-logging-to-file.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Settings Window\r\n\r\n![Settings Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjmagee/swtor-caster/master/Screenshots/settings.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Main Window\r\n\r\n![Main Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjmagee/swtor-caster/master/Screenshots/main.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Logger Window\r\n\r\n![Logger 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjmagee/swtor-caster/master/Screenshots/logger.jpg)\r\n\r\n##### With Ability text enabled\r\n\r\n![Logger 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjmagee/swtor-caster/master/Screenshots/logger-text-enabled.jpg)\r\n\r\n### [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/)\r\n\r\n![OBS Capture Setting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjmagee/swtor-caster/master/Screenshots/window-capture-settings.jpg)\r\n\r\n![OBS Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjmagee/swtor-caster/master/Screenshots/example-usage-1.jpg)\r\n\r\n![OBS Example 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjmagee/swtor-caster/master/Screenshots/example-usage-2.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
